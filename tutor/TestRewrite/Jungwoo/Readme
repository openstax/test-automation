Jungwoo's stuff

Here is the Selenium code I have written so far.

I ended up doing a very significant portion of the intern project and thus in the later weeks of the internship,
was unable to work on the selenium scripts much.

But, here is my Selenium stuff.

There are most likely bugs within the Selenium I have written, and some of the scripts are incomplete.
My original runthrough of the scripts was going through them 1 by 1, and I realized
that some of them were very difficult to automate, so I skipped them to save for later. 
However, now, at the end of the internship, I have run out of time...  I apologize for not 
being able to resolve them and for the bugs you might encounter. 

Testrail ready.

Oh, and I added a couple of new functions into my version of helper.py, namely random_course, which 
chooses a random Tutor course, and open_help_menu, which opens the help menu. I also fixed a couple
of functions that were not working such as goto_menu_item
