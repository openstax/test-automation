Calendar

test_create_assignment_links_teacher.py 
single test 
STATUS: consistently fails, apparently due to a problem with the add_assignment function from the staxing repo. when the script tries to create 
a reading assignment using that function, it fails.
VERDICT: needs more work

--

course_setting_roster

test_teacher_move_drop_readd_students.py
single test
STATUS: I corrected an outdated reference to “course settings and roster” link in the user dropdown menu (those two functions are separate and 
now under the actions menu). i also edited the script to manually click (with action chains) popovers that the driver could not find with XPATH.
VERDICT: currently passes

--

Dashboard

test_student_tutor_navigation_shortcuts.py
single test
STATUS: the test appears to be failing, apparently not due to coding issues, but because I am using the “free trial” version of the student page, so 
whenever the system tries to click the dropdown menu, it instead clicks on the “pay now” button, even though when I run the test myself, I can 
click the dropdown menu without a problem.
VERDICT: problem with account needs to be resolved before we can determine if the test code needs further revision

test_student_view_various_aspects_on_course_dashboard.py 
single test
STATUS: as above, the test is failing because the student account is in “free trial” mode
VERDICT: problem with account needs to be resolved before we can determine if the test code needs further revision

--

Event

test_tutor_event_teacher.py 
multiple tests
STATUS: I edited this file extensively so that most, though not all, of the tests consistently pass
VERDICT: needs minor revision to make all tests pass

--

External\Teacher

test_tutor_external_teacher.py
multiple tests
STATUS: I edited this file extensively so that all but one of the tests passes at last check
VERDICT: needs minor revision to make the last test pass

test_external_assignment_from_scores.py
single test
STATUS: appears to still be unfinished
VERDICT: code needs to be finished before it can be tested

--

Homework\Student

test_open_homework_immediate_student.py 
contains just one test that needs to be checked out
STATUS: as stated in notes, needs to be linked up with helper functions so that the helper function doesn't need to be inside the test file.
fouls up on the “create an assignment” function, a recurring problem
although all of the steps outlined in the notes appear to be included in the code, there is no line at the end to actually set the test to passing 
VERDICT: script should be updated to remove extraneous helper files, then further revised so that it passes

test_start_late_homework_student.py 
STATUS: “pretty much done”, as above, the notes call for the removal of in-file helper functions. these in-file helper functions seem to be out of date, 
and cause consistent failures
VERDICT: script should be updated to remove extraneous helper files, then further revised so that it passes

test_working_hw_assignment.py 
STATUS: has one test that is unfinished
VERDICT: code needs to be finished before it can be tested 

--

Homework\Teacher

test_tutor_homework_teacher.py
STATUS: I have done some editing, and now most, but not all, of the tests pass
VERDICT: needs minor revision to make sure all tests pass

test_new_t1_16_CreateAHomework.py
STATUS: appears to be an older version of test_tutor_homework_teacher.py with fewer tests
VERDICT: outdated, no need to work on

test_homework_assignment_from_scores_teacher.py
STATUS: “mostly written”, unfinished
VERDICT: code needs to be finished before it can be tested

--

Performance_Forecast

test_assessment errata_form_student.py 
STATUS: the test appears to be failing, not due to coding issues, but because I am using the “free trial” version of the student page, so whenever the system tries to click the dropdown menu, 
it instead clicks on the “pay now” button, even though when I run the test myself, I can click the dropdown menu without a problem. other than that, this test looks like it should pass
VERDICT: problem with account needs to be resolved before we can determine if the test code needs further revision

test_performance_practice_student.py 
STATUS: as above, the test is failing because the student account is in “free trial” mode
VERDICT: problem with account needs to be resolved before we can determine if the test code needs further revision

test_student_functionality_of_performance_forecast.py 
STATUS: the code appears to be calling on a drop down menu button that no longer exists. additionally, this test requires that a student account exists that has previously answered enough
questions that the performance forecast has data to draw on - something that's not necessarily set up by this test
VERDICT: needs further revision to pass

test_student_more_performance_forecast_functions.py 
STATUS: as above, the test relies on an outdated menu link, but also needs setup to ensure that the performance forecast can work
VERDICT: needs examination, then revision if it fails

test_student_user_with_only_one_course_and_no_work_done.py 
STATUS: fails almost immediately due to a problem with the student not having “desired_capabilities”
VERDICT: needs revision to pass

VERDICT: needs further revision for all tests to pass

test_reading_assignment_from_scores_teacher.py 
STATUS: not all written yet
VERDICT: code needs to be finished before it can be tested

test_tutor_reading_teacher.py
