NOTES FOR USER:
For each test in the original test suite, I’ve added where it corresponds to in the current test
I’ve also added next to that case the expected result that we should see

The code was intentionally left separate (as basically one test method per file) and not integrated together in order to make the code easier to read. This way, there’s less clutter, and the user can pretty much tell the subject of a file from a more specific title

MY APPROACH TO WRITING THESE TEST SCRIPTS:
My aim with these test scripts was to make something that could run nearly all of them in one go —> the one flaw with this, however, is that they’re all one big test case. If one of them fails, then we’ll never get to the test cases that deal with a separate aspect of that subsystem and come after. However, they might be working perfectly fine.

The advantage of doing things this way is that once we have something that fits smoothly together you can run full through, you can break it down into further test cases. I ensure that you’d be able to do this by organizing the test cases in a very logical manner — all the test cases pertaining to a certain function in a subsystem are grouped together. This way, you can break the entire test script off  at a certain place, and with minimal setup, have it working as an independent test case.

Where to set the junction points of the current test cases is a matter of the discretion of the next person to look at these scripts

THINGS TO DO:
Something that I didn’t include in my documentation because it applied to every single case was that these test cases still lack the test identifying number that the current test scripts have.
This means that the test cases must still be added in to test rail and assigned a unique test id. From there, the test id’s must be attached to the end of each test case in the script
You might find it useful to give a sub-identifier for each waypoint in the test script

Also, the code for the test scripts to update and report results to sauce labs must still be added. I couldn’t do this while we still hadn’t assigned test id’s to each script

How to run the test scripts from command line
LOCALRUN =true py.pytest -v -x <script name>
-s will show the print statements from the test script

FURTHER POSSIBLE WORK:
Further modularize the test scripts so that functions that we perform often (e.g. creating a homework or reading assignment as a teacher, working through an assignment as a student, retrieving a course number or generating an assignment name), can be handled by a particular piece of code that is referenced whenever it’s needed
